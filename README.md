<h1>NBodyNN</h1>
<p>Dissecting NBodySimulations outputs, statistically inspecting, and classifying them. â€” <b>Final Project for the Wolfram Summer Camp 2019</b></p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In this project, I analyze n-body simulations outputs and their patterns by utilizing different statistical methods, visualization algorithms, and feature extraction techniques. Using an n-body simulation random generation technique, a sample of 5000 different outputs could be generated. By performing feature extraction processes, some interesting visualizations about the different outcomes from the simulations were plotted on a two-dimensional feature space plot. Additional conclusions were made using the distribution of the center-of-mass, and a two-body mass visualization.</p>

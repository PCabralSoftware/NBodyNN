<h1>NBodyNN</h1>
> A neural network for predicting ```NBodySimulations``` outputs and classifiying with labels such as "chaotic", "repetitive" and "sparse". â€” WSC 2019 Final Project

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In this project, I propose a method to predict n-body simulations outputs and their patterns by utilizing neural networks and feature gathering techniques. N-body simulations demand lots of computer processing, and by predicting the output as a class, more computational power can be saved. The method consists of a neural network architecture that receives the bodies data about mass, weight, velocity, and positions in a brief lapse of time, and outputs the class of the simulation, such as "chaotic", "repetitive" or "orbital". The purpose of this project is to develop a method for predicting the result of an n-body simulation without evaluating it, saving processing time.</p>
